### Summary

(Summarize the new feature that you are proposing concisely.  This should be something that developers can quickly glance at to understand the basic details of your proposed new feature, no more than a paragraph.)

### Problem to solve

(Brief description of what this feature attempts to solve.  Are you implementing a new level of theory that predicts a physical property more accurately?  Are you attempting to implement a new form of parallelization that will speed up pre-existing functionality in the code?  Please don't copy-paste the Background section of your upcoming manuscript here.)

### Proposal

(Describe here how you believe the feature could be implemented.  Please note any changes to keywords in the control.in or geometry.in files that would be necessary, as well as changes to FHI-aims' internal API.)

### Personal contribution

(How much time are you willing to contribute to work on this issue?  Note that your request is far more likely to succeed if you are willing to take the initative on this.)

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

(If no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this)

### Links / references

(References to information about the feature can be placed here.  If you know of papers or other electronic structure code that have implemented the feature in a similar fashion, please also reference them here.)
